# Sitecore.Support.377674
The Auto Publish workflow action did not enable you to configure publishing mode and used republish mode by default. 
This has been fixed so that the mode can now be changed by using the &#8220;smart=1&#8221; parameter in the Parameters field.

**[Fixed]** The bug has been fixed in Sitecore 8.0 Update-6 (rev. 151127):
